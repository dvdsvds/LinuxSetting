-- How to set up git auto-authentication --

This guide explains how to set up Git auto-authentication.

To do this, you'll need your GitHub email and a personal access token, as they are required for authentication.

First, go to GitHub to generate your Git token.
Once you've accessed the site, click your profile icon in the top-right corner.
A dropdown menu will appear â€” from there, click on "Settings".
On the Settings page, you'll find "Developer settings" at the bottom of the menu on the left.
Click "Tokens (classic)" to proceed, and then click the "Generate new token (classic)" button.
From this point on, read the instructions carefully, select the required scopes, and generate your token.

Now, let's set up auto-authentication.

Go to your project directory, then locate the .git/config file.
Open the config file using vi, nano, or any text editor.
After opening it, you'll find the url field under the [remote "origin"] section.

It will look something like this:
https://github.com/{your-username}/{project-name}.git

Replace it with the following:
https://{your-username}:{your-token}@github.com/{your-username}/{project-name}.git

Now, when you use the git push command, you'll notice that it no longer asks for authentication.
